# Virginia Tech Dining Services Web Scraper

During my freshman year, I started seriously tracking my calories and overall nutrition in conjunction with pursuing new personal fitness goals. I have intermittently continued this tracking habit and recently got back into doing it during my junior year. Tech's dining services website has separate pages dedicated to the different dining halls on campus, so I created a web scraper using the Jsoup library that navigates and pulls all of the associated nutrition facts for the foods in a dining hall. By pulling the links for the foods from a Treemap, I use the Java AWT Desktop class to automatically open the nutrition facts page for a food of the user's choice using the default system browser which simplifies and quickens the search process for this data.
